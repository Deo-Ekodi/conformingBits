>Device Files
	-Everything is a file(devices inclusive)
	-devices are located in /dev direrctory
	-devices have major / minor numbers (allocated statically in '''devices.txt''') and also dynamically
	-user space is exposed to (char, block and network) devices and some are abstract
	-
	-
	-
	-
	-
>Major & Minor Numbers
	-each device instance has major(char & block drivers) & minor numbers(device instance)
	-minor number not recognized by kernel(only used by driver)
	-
	-
> /proc & procfs
	- '/proc' is a virtual filesystem of type procfs -> (all files & directories in /proc (exist in memory))
	- '/proc' is used to import useful info from kernel - used byb subsystems, drivers & core functionality (just like a mess)
	-
	-
> /sys & sysfs	
	-new way of exporting kernel info to user-space
	-will eventually replace /proc
	-contains multiple views of same hardware :
		>bus view(/sys/bus)
		>device view(/sys/devices)
		>class view(/sys/class)
	-
	-
	-
> /dev & udev	
	-main repo for device nodes
	-udev dynamically creates entries in /dev
	-can be configured to provide persistent view
